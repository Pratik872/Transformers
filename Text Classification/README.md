# Transformers Used Cases : 
This is a repository containing projects of various Transformers used cases like Text Classification, Multilingual Named Entity Recognition, Text Generation, Summarization, Question Answering. <br><br>
<b>A state of art model is not useful if it doesn't serve the purpose properly</b><br>
For example, what if your model has high performace metric but it is too slow or large to meet the business requirements?

_Note: Data used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only._

	- [Flight Fare Predictor](https://github.com/Pratik872/ML/tree/main/E2E%20Project/FlightFarePredictor): The dataset contains about 10682 records for various airlines and their details. I have built a model to predict the flight fares based on the feaatures. Click on the link for more details.

	- [Zoo Animal Classification](https://github.com/Pratik872/ML/tree/main/E2E%20Project/Zoo%20Animal%20Classification): This dataset conatins about 101 records for different animals in the zoo and their classes. I have built a model to predict the animal class based on their features. Click on link for more details.
