# Transformers Used Cases : 
This is a repository containing projects of various Transformers used cases like Text Classification, Multilingual Named Entity Recognition, Text Generation, Summarization, Question Answering. <br><br>
<b>FACT - A state of art model is not useful if it doesn't serve the purpose properly</b><br>
For example, what if your model has high performace metric but it is too slow or large to meet the business requirements?</br>

Techniques such as Knowledge Distillation, Quantization, Pruning and Graph Optimization comes in play at such times. I have tried to explore these techniques and implement in the projects.

_Note: Data used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only._
